# Hand-outs: How Does Calculus Describe Motion?

Welcome to the **Hand-outs** repository! This project is dedicated to making educational resources—specifically, handouts about calculus and its application to motion—freely available to students, educators, and anyone interested in learning more about this essential topic.

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains a LaTeX source file (`main.tex`) for a comprehensive handout titled:

**How Does Calculus Describe Motion?**  
_A way to measure changes_  
Author: Talha Zobair  
BDOAA Nat' Camper '24, '25

The handout is designed to help high school students (especially juniors and sophomores) and Olympiad participants strengthen their understanding of calculus fundamentals, with practical examples drawn from physics (motion, velocity, acceleration, etc.). The document covers:

- Introduction to motion and calculus
- Mathematical description of position, velocity, and acceleration
- Derivatives and their use in describing change
- Second derivatives (acceleration)
- Integrals and accumulating change
- Real-world applications (worked examples)
- Further reading and resources

## How to Use This Repository

### Viewing the Handout

The main content is in `main.tex`, a LaTeX file. To view the handout:

1. **Compile the LaTeX Source**  
   - Download `main.tex` to your computer.
   - Use a LaTeX editor (e.g., Overleaf, TeXShop, TeXworks, or an online compiler like Overleaf) to compile the file and generate a PDF.
   - Make sure to place any required images referenced in the document (`position_vs_time_plot.png`, `velocity_tangent_curve.png`, `Free_fall_curve.png`) in the same directory as `main.tex`.

2. **Install LaTeX (if needed)**  
   - [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (Linux/Windows/Mac)
   - [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/) (Windows)
   - [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) (Mac)

3. **Compile Command (example):**
   ```bash
   pdflatex main.tex
   ```
   This will produce `main.pdf`.
